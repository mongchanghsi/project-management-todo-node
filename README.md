### Inspiration
As I handle a few personal projects, I tend to have several thoughts in mind on what can be future improvement or bugs that I might need to solve. Hence, I enhanced a normal todo application with folder capability, to able to categories my todo into projects. While Trello is available for such purpose, I decided to attempt to develop one using MaterialUI as a practice. This entire project is developed using MERN stack.

### Features
1. Add task folders
2. Add task specifically to folder
3. Delete task
4. Delete task folder
5. NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB for APIs and storing of data

### Future Update
Working on personal account features for expansion.
